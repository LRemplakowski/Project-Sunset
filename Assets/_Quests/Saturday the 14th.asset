    Description: "Saturday June 14th, 1986. You are Desiree Bardot. A PI working
      in the heart of  Las Vegas. In another life you were a respected journalist

      the only company you keep is cockroaches as you struggle to make rent for your
      crummy apartment in West Vegas. Things could be worse..."
