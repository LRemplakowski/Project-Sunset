<<set $playerNickname to "Deputee">>
[nomarkup][Your journey is rather uneventful. Dominic is sitting behind his wheel, visibly relaxed, smoking his next cigarette. He had at least some decency to open up the window on his side so the smoke gets sucked out or is pushed behind. It looks rather hilarious that he drives with his sunglasses in the middle of the night also having dark glass of his car before him. But he seems to see just fine, only occasionally disregarding red light on the road. The engine roars soaring through the Vegas streets. It sounds like he has a real beast under the hood. Other than that the interior of the car is silent. Eerily silent even. It makes you somewhat uncomfortable - considering that several minutes earlier you survived hell. You feel as though you’re on another planet. It seems that normally talkative Sheriff doesn’t want to be intrusive and allows you to gather your thoughts in silence.][/nomarkup]

{$sheriff}: You can take em, they’re yours Deputee. I have a whole cupboard of those in my place. Practically a connoisseur of the things.
[nomarkup][You put a cig in your mouth and light it up with the car lighter. You take in the smoke with a deep breath into your lungs. It doesn’t give the same “kick” or “taste” as usual, but it’s still a shred of a normal life you had… seemingly like centuries ago. You close your eyes for a second allowing your senses to drift with the smoke.][/nomarkup]

And you can’t go back now, the machine was set in motion an’ all you did was handle the final product. You can try to stop it, but it’ll most likely grind you to dust along with her.

{$sheriff}: You betcha. Dodge Charger, 3rd generation. Bought freshly from the assembly line in the 70s. Still in great shape after all these years, she’s a bit like me really. I can’t even count how many times it saved my unlife and how many races we’ve won. Sprints are my favorite. The only thing that isn’t original is the hood and several parts. I had to adjust this sweetie into the best street racin’ car because most usually people hear me before they see me. It’s like a trademark right now. When you hear V8 headin’ your way you can assume it’s me. And never EVER try to scratch my baby.

It will help you because boons are nearly the only currency that any Kindred will accept. Without reputation or favors owed you won’t be able to survive for long. An’ for the love of all that’s holy find a group of Kindred in a similar situation to yours. Young and wantin’ to prove themselves. Nights are not easy to survive on your own. You’ll need someone you can at least depend on.
