[nomarkup][The phone has been disconnected, but you can plug it back in. It's most likely Dominic who's responsible given that the cord seems to have been ripped out of the wall. You can feel the urge to call Arthur, ask him to come over and stay with you - but you couldn't even if you wanted to.][/nomarkup]

You feel a slight jolt in your arm at the shoulder and a green light flashes.][/nomarkup]
-> [nomarkup][Dial up Arthur.][/nomarkup]
    [nomarkup][You wait for a few minutes for the phone to ring and find that it hasn't rung. After a few minutes it's clear that it isn't dialing and becomes tomorrow's problem.][/nomarkup]
-> [nomarkup][Put the phone in its cradle.][/nomarkup]
    [nomarkup][You look at the phone and immediately think better of it. There's nothing you want to do less than call Arthur and burden him even more. Setting the phone in its cradle, you return to the rest of the apartment.][/nomarkup]

    [nomarkup][You wait for a few minutes for the phone to ring and find that it hasn't rung. After a few minutes, it's clear that it isn't dialing. You figure that the problem might be that the power isn't holding steady. Maybe if you found something to hold the chord together?][/nomarkup]

Setting the phone in its cradle, you return to the rest of the apartment. As you do you see that the cord has been jostled by the notion, a light that was blinking green having turned off briefly. Maybe if you had some duct tape you could fix the cord?] [/nomarkup]
