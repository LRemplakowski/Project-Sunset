[nomarkup][Pulling off your shirt and pants you can feel the sticky slick of blood and grime clinging to you. It's gotten into your hair and is caked anywhere that it could touch. As you rub your eye in agitation you can feel it seal shut against the agitation of the thick iron smell of blood coming off your hands. You can see blood and bits of gore that Anastasia didn't clean when she was moving Diego's corpse out and as you flick the shower head on, twisting the knob to hot you can see the water turn black as it washes the events of the evening off of you.][/nomarkup]
{$anastasia}: You got any towels or clothes in this whole fuckin' place? Or do you just stand naked in the laundry mat? [nomarkup][She cracks the door and shouts at you from behind it.][/nomarkup] Seriously Princess what's the deal do you not have any jamies?

[nomarkup][You stare at the water as it swirls around the drain, slowly turning from black to a muddy brown as it soaks off the dirt and starts to slowly work the blood off of your skin. For a moment it's almost as if you're washing away the events of the evening. Resetting yourself back to a few hours ago when things were dire but less so, your eyes simply glaze over as you hear Anastasia's voice fade slightly into simply background noise.][/nomarkup]
{$anastasia}: De-s-ree! Des-ree! DESIREE!! [nomarkup][Her voice becomes more clear as she knocks on the wall in the bathroom. You can see her silhouette through the shower curtain.][/nomarkup]
-> {$pcName}: I don't feel good. [nomarkup][Your voice sounds distant even to you. The pounding noise of the shower feels overwhelming but the idea of standing up is even worse.][/nomarkup]
<<if GetCompanionInfluence ($anastasia)==1>>

{$anastasia}: You're uh… you're not naked are you?
[nomarkup][You look down at yourself and shudder, and not just because you're covered head to toe in dirt, gore, and who knows what.][/nomarkup]
-> {$pcName}: I'm in the shower Ana.
{$anastasia}: Yeah I can see that. Gimme a minute. [nomarkup][There's some rustling and some pulling and when she pulls the shower curtain you can see she's closed her eyes and is looking away, holding a towel out to you. As you grab it and wrap it around yourself she gets into the shower with you and leans her back against yours. The fabric slowly absorbs the dirty water and inching up bit by bit.][/nomarkup]
-> {$pcName}: Thanks.
{$anastasia}: You're fucking mess, Princess. A goddamn fucking mess. How'd you even get yourself into this? A cute girl like you got yourself a nice boyfriend - a life. Did you die in a home invasion or some shit?
-> {$pcName}: Lucia's a bitch. She's such a fucking bitch.
{$anastasia}: You're a - you know what no. She is a bitch. And you survived her, you know? She's a cunt and you fucked her shit up, whatever plan she had you're not going along with it and I think that's… I think that's pretty badass of you.
-> {$pcName}: You really think so?
[nomarkup][Anastasia leans her head against your shoulder, her back pressed against your back even as the towel completely soaks through and her jacket gets soggy. She takes a big inhale and sighs.][/nomarkup]
{$anastasia}: I would have had a hard time with Twinkle Toes and Captain Pig. Sheriff wanna be Dominatrix and his bitch of a wife who said you should be killed for the crime of being born.
-> {$pcName}: I don't think you can say that.
{$anastasia}: Really Princess now's when you want to be a rules follower?
[nomarkup][You can feel a laugh bubble up in your throat and the goth woman smiles, you can feel her cheeks turn up as she does. She sits there for a few moments with you in silence. Probably trying to figure out what to say but not landing on anything. At least the silence is comfortable.][/nomarkup]
{$anastasia}: Do you feel better? Because I'll be honest I think I'm going to have a wet spot on my ass for the rest of the night. [nomarkup][Her tone is light and you can hear her smiling.][/nomarkup]
-> {$pcName}: How'd you know this would help? 
{$anastasia}: Just do Princess, I'm smart like that. Think you're ready to get out of the shower?
[nomarkup][You see that the water has finally started to run clear, your locks hanging in a somewhat tangled mess of now clear curls around her face and you know you're going to have to spend some time detangling them. You do feel better, less cold and achy. You nod and Anastasia gets up, stepping out of the shower and looking for more towels groaning with sadness when she finds that you only had two. You can hear her cursing as she kicks your dirty clothes off to the side and as you stand and turn the water off you can see she's already left the bathroom - a set of fresh clothes left for you to change into.][/nomarkup]

{$anastasia}: Hey whatever you need. I'm not here to reenact Scream. Okay, I've got a towel out here and some clothes. Cool.
[nomarkup][A long time passes with you seated in the shower, your eyes unfocused as you watch the water slosh around the shower. Your mind racing with thoughts and yet completely empty][/nomarkup]
{$innerVoice}: I did what I had to do.
{$beast}: And I did it well.
{$innerVoice}: I wouldn't have killed those people if they weren't trying to kill me.
{$beast}: And I survived because I'm strong.
{$innerVoice}: Am I a bad person? I murdered Diego.
{$beast}: I didn't choose that. I didn't want to.
{$innerVoice}: Does that matter? Diego didn't want to die.

{$anastasia}: Goddamnit. Well yeah, Desiree you killed like eight people. Have you ever killed anyone before?
[nomarkup][Your silence answers for you as you stare blankly into the water.][/nomarkup]
{$beast}: Who is she to judge me?
{$anastasia}: Listen, Princess, the first few are always hard. Eventually, you get the fuck over yourself. Do you think anyone just wakes up one day with nerves of steel and great tits? No. They don't.
-> {$pcName}: What because they're not you?
{$anastasia}: No because no one is born fucking evil you little brat.
-> {$pcName}: Is this supposed to make me feel better?
[nomarkup][Anastasia growls and you can feel the Beast growl in your chest in response. It causes the older vampire to pause for a moment.][/nomarkup]
{$anastasia}: You're such a baby. [nomarkup][She grouses and you can hear the jangle of beads as she runs her hands through her hair.][/nomarkup] I keep forgetting you're like two hours old.
-> {$pcName}: What the fuck is wrong with you Anastasia?
{$anastasia}: A lot Princess. Anyway. Towels on the counter. Clothes under it. Dead guy's in the closet. Have a nice shower.

You can hear pounding on the bathroom wall and feel your body tense. A wild surging fear claws at you as you feel danger coming in all around you. Prickles of water against your skin, the flaking of drywall above you, the shouting from beyond the curtain a standing shadow that is taller than you from your seated position in the shower. You feel a burning in your throat in your eyes, and an itch in your hands. The shower is coated in blood and you can feel bits of skin with muscle attached float past your foot. You have to defend yourself or you're going to die in here - ][/nomarkup]

[nomarkup][Your eyes flash with an image of yourself in Diego's place. Dead and lifeless in the shower. There's something haunting and strange about this place. Even without the body in it that the idea of being in this space is almost magnetically repellant. You cannot imagine stepping into it at all, much less trying to step into the shower. You shake your head.][/nomarkup]

[nomarkup][You walk into the bathroom and are met with the same sight you saw this evening Diego remains exactly where you left him, though his eye has now detached and fallen into the bathtub. Bright red oxygenated blood has dried down to a dull black and his face looks terrified. Frozen forever in an expression of unimaginable fear, fear you now understand yourself in some ways. Rigor mortis has set in and his skin has a grayish tint to it.][/nomarkup]
