{$diana}: Your Childe just killed some of our men.
{$lucia}: I'm almost proud.

{$lucia}: Ah there you are, my blood. So glad you could make it. [nomarkup][She isn’t surprised to see you. If anything she looks pleased.][/nomarkup]
{$beast}: Arrogant bitch. I need to show her her place. Who does she think she is?
[nomarkup][There’s so much you want to say to her. The woman who killed you. Ironically, you have to admit that since dying, you’ve never felt more alive. In the moment though only one thing comes to mind.][/nomarkup]

//SFX for screeching tires, black van comes into the scene, ghouls come out of it//
[nomarkup][As if on cue, a van rips through the concrete. There’s a loud SCREECH as the brakes hit a sudden stop before Lucia. The doors fly open before her. What you assume to be ghouls are at the ready with assault weapons, waiting for a cue.][/nomarkup]
{$lucia}: I’m flattered love. Truly. But now isn’t the time.  So close, but you still have yet to prove your worth. 
[nomarkup][One of the ghouls takes her by the hand to guide her into the van. Diana tries to follow, but the ghouls stand in her way.][/nomarkup]
{$diana}: What the fuck? Let me pass.
[nomarkup][The ghouls do not budge.][/nomarkup]
{$diana}: Lucia!
{$lucia}: Sorry love. You’ve outlived your usefulness. Tada. [nomarkup][She signals to the ghouls to close the doors.][/nomarkup]
{$diana}: You bitch! I loved you! I ruined my whole life and you betrayed me like this! [nomarkup][The punk before you is distraught. In a way, you know how it feels.][/nomarkup] This is all your fault!
-> {pcName}: Mine? You’re joking right?
    {$diana}: If you hadn’t shown up she would have Embraced me instead! I should be the one being tested!
    //initiate combat//
-> {pcName}: She would have abandoned you either way. Surrender. (Manipulation + Leadership)
-> {pcName}: I could say the same to you.
    {$diana}: You don’t even appreciate what’s she given you. Yet you rub my face in it.
