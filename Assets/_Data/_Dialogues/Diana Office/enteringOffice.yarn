[nomarkup][The small office is a blend of cozy and gaudy. Rude British accents like a bust of Queen Victoria make the room almost feel like a real embassy office, but the neon glow of the Union Jack and the rich bar rack tell you it’s still a nightclub. A citrus perfume wafts in the air. The smell is awfully familiar, but its owner is nowhere to be seen.][/nomarkup]

{$anastasia}: Maybe she fucked off somewhere for a wank.
{$kieran}: ...You are so repetitive, Ms Goth Queen. No originality.
{$anastasia}: It still succeeded in annoying you, though. And not all of us are virgins.
{$kieran}: Not all of us are nymphomaniacs.
{$anastasia}: Oooh spicy. Kate’s favorite dog has some bite, after all.

<<if Roll ("Intelligence","Awareness")>=3>>
    <<set $missKaminska to true>>
    [nomarkup][Kieran hasn’t ever called her that, before… The change in how he’s addressing her could be a subtle indication that Anastasia is treading headlong into dangerous territory. That Kieran is uncomfortable and may lash out, if she continues to insult him.][/nomarkup]

        -> {$pcName}: Guys, I think it’s time we stopped bickering and focused on the task at hand. Time is running short, and we still haven’t the faintest clue who my Sire is.
        {$anastasia}: Nice pep talk, but I’ve got no horse in this race.
        -> {$pcName}: But you [nomarkup]<i>are</i>[/nomarkup] curious about who they are, right?
        {$anastasia}: [nomarkup][She sighs.][/nomarkup] Fiiiine. You got me. I’m pretty solidly hooked on this dollar-store detective mystery you got going on, at this point, so I’ll behave.

        -> {$pcName}: Anastasia, I know how fun you find pushing Kieran’s buttons, but guess who’s going to have to clean up the mess if this comes to blows… That’s right, it’s you. Doesn’t that sound like a drag? And Kieran, you don’t need more work, right? All in all, this seems like a silly argument to have, given how boring the consequences will be.
        {$anastasia}: I don’t wanna admit it, but when you’re right, you’re right. S’not worth the hassle.

{$anastasia}: Oh, look. It’s Kieran - the wettest of blankets, here to make some for me. Just remember, little puppy, you already introduced me to the one who holds your leash, so you’re gonna have to come up with a different subject to be annoying about. I’m sure it’ll be easy for you, though, given your track record.
{$kieran}: [nomarkup][He scowls, glaring daggers at Anastasia. Something about what she said seems to have struck a chord with him. The next words he utters are polite, but frigid - the tone of them harsh.][/nomarkup] This aggression is unnecessary, miss Kaminska. I suggest you cease your provocations before you say something you will truly regret…
<<if Roll ("Wits","Awareness")>=3>>
    [nomarkup][He gets the words out, but from the tension still lingering in his jaw, it is clear that he is restraining a temper threatening to violently erupt.][/nomarkup]

<<if Roll ("Intelligence","Insight")>=4>>
    [nomarkup][Kieran doesn’t generally react this way to goading or ridicule, and the only piece of that statement that was unique is the reference to him as a dog - collared and led by Kate’s leash. Given how upset he got, perhaps there is more to their relationship than meets the eye? Something to ask Kieran about later, maybe.][/nomarkup]
    <<set $kieranOutburst to true>>

{$anastasia}: Fine, can do. Dunno what his problem is, though. [nomarkup][She shrugs, the ghost of a smirk still present on her lips, turning on her heel and wandering off to idly browse the office.][/nomarkup]
{$kieran}: [nomarkup][As soon as she backs off, the tension drains from Kieran’s posture. He huffs out a long sigh, then turns to you.][/nomarkup] Ready to return to the investigation, miss Bardot? (+1 Kieran Reputation)

{$kieran}: [nomarkup][He frowns.][/nomarkup] I apologize if I’m not eager to “mess around” with a miscreant like her when my objective and the consequences for failure have been made abundantly clear. They should be just as comprehensible and urgent to you. (-1 Kieran Reputation)

{$anastasia:}: [nomarkup][She sticks out her tongue at Kieran, then shows her teeth in a satisfied grin.][/nomarkup] I win. Sucks to suck, Fido - looks like you’re in the dog house on this one. (+1 Anastasia Reputation)

{$kieran}: We have much more important things to do than waiting time with childish Kindred bickering.
{$anastasia}: Geez, you both are so stiff...
{$kieran}: Well… considering that we are all Kindred spirits… I would say that stiffness runs in the family. [nomarkup][He brightens up a bit at his own joke.][/nomarkup]
{$anastasia}: Touche. [nomarkup][She’s trying not to grin, but the joke was too terrible not to crack at least a little bit of a smile.][/nomarkup]
