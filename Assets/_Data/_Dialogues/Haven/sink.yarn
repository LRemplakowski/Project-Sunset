{$journal} I can't live like this anymore.

    [You forgot the sink was clogged. Your reflection in the water, now tinted red, stares back at you. You look terrible - even more so than usual… Like you’re terminally ill.]
    [The idea fills you with dread… How’s that possible? Yesterday, you were fine! What’s worse is, you can’t afford a visit to the ER, either. You have no choice but to wait and hope that it’s not as serious as it looks… You’re not ready to die.]

                (Success) [As you open up the U-Pipe, what is undeniably cold blood squirts out. The bloody bile looks and feels disgusting on your skin, but despite that fact, you find yourself transfixed by the fluid. You have to put in quite a bit of effort to refocus on unclogging the sink.]

                (Failure) [The pipe breaks off into your hands. What is undeniably backed-up blood sprays you soaked.

        -> [Throw the eye quickly back into the sink in a panic.]
            [A wet PLOP is audible as it splashes into the half-full, bloodstained sink. It bobs up and down, chaotically spinning until the pupil of its deep brown iris settles on you. Its gaze feels almost accusatory.]

            [You stare at your now-empty, bloodstained palm. A crushing wave of negative emotion washes over you. You feel like bursting into tears.]
