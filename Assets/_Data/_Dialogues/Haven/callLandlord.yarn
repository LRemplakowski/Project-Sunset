[You pick up the receiver.]
-> [Call the police.] <<if $police == true>>
    {$beast} To change one cage for another? Not the smartest thing to do.
    [A strange whisper in your head compels you to stop, and surprisingly, you can't disagree with it. Your conscience won't win tonight. You're not going to jail.]
    <<set $police to false>>

    {$landlord} Sunset Acres Apartments, how can I help you?
    {$pcname} Hey Kevin, it's Desiree. Sink is clogged again.
    {$landlord} [You can hear his contempt through the phone.] Again? There's no way. I just fixed it last week. You must be washing grease down the drain. Not my problem. Hire a plumber.
    -> {$pcname} I'll pay you for your time.
        [Now you're speaking his language.]
        {$landlord} I'll have to charge you a… uh… a late night fee. $200.
        -> {$pcname} [You grit your teeth.] Sure.
            [He hangs up.]

            {$landlord} I'm a capitalist. Take it or leave it. I'm going back to bed.
            {$pcname} Fine. I'll take it.
            -> [Hang up.]

    -> (Charisma + Subterfuge) {$pcname} [You spend several moments gathering up the willpower to make your voice sound more appealing - or the closest thing to what you assume is appealing to this man that you can muster.] What if I make it worth your while? <<if visited("ChaSubtKevin") == false>>

        (Success) {$landlord} It must be hard for you, not having a man in your life. Wearing the pants is more difficult than you'd expect, huh? Guess I'll have to help out - show you the ropes.
        [In response, you make an expression that is equal parts revolted, frustrated, and perturbed. Why does the world have to go out of its way to remind you that people with opinions like this still exist? You swallow the emotion with some effort.]
        {$pcname} Yeah, it's been difficult. But you don't want to hear about the woes of a poor, depressed divorcee…
        {$landlord} Ah, but I've said I would teach you, didn't I? Just let me get dressed. Think you can hold it together until I get there?
        {$pcname} Sure. Please, don't keep me waiting. [You say this through teeth gritted in a smile that doesn't reach your eyes. It's a saccharine-sweet, enthusiastic tone - your customer service voice.]
