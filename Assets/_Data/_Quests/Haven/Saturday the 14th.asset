  Description: "Saturday June 14th, 1986. I am Desiree Bardot. A PI working in the
    heart of Las Vegas. In another life I was a respected journalist bringing accountability
    to those in power, but now I often find myself digging up dirt for those same
    powerbrokers. When I can find work that is. I used to have it all: money, career,
    and a \u201Chappy\u201D marriage. Now the only company I keep is cockroaches
    as I struggle to make rent for my crummy apartment in West Vegas. Things could
    be worse. I suppose."
