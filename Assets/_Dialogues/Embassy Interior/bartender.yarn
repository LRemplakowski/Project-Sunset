[nomarkup][The bartender is drying a glass with a dishrag. Looking up from her work, she spots you at the other side of the counter.][/nomarkup]
{Bartender}: Sorry about that. What can I get you?
<<if $drink ==0>>
-> {pcName}: I'll have a Bloody Mary.
    {Bartender}: Coming right up! 
    [nomarkup][She rushes to the other end of the bar and starts making your drink.][/nomarkup]
    {$kieran}: You know you won't be able to drink it right?
    <<if GetIsPartyMemberRecruited("ANASTASIA") is true>>

-> {pcName}: So, what can you tell me about Diana?
    {Bartender}: She's nice enough. Been seeing someone who kinda gives me a bad feeling, but I can't put my finger on why.
    -> {pcName}: Bad feeling?
        {Bartender}: foo. She only hangs around her office when Kate isn't here.
-> {pcName}: Nothing, nevermind.
