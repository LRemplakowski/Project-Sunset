[nomarkup][Your words sing to his ears like honey. His frigid stance warms up as he fawns over you.][/nomarkup] #success
Bouncer: I'd love to miss, but someone as special as you should go in through the back. Not that I'm thinking about your back… it's just for “people” like you. Could I… get your number?

{$kieran}: We're running late.
Bouncer: Was I talking to you?
{$pcName}: … Guess I should head on back.
Bouncer: Yeah… totally… I get that. Come back later, alright.
