The articy:draft localization importer uses Unity-QuickSheet
to read Excel files. You must download Unity-QuickSheet here:

https://github.com/kimsama/Unity-QuickSheet

To download it, click the green Code button and select Download ZIP.
After downloading, unzip the ZIP file.

Then put the "Quick Sheet" folder and "Quick Sheet.meta" files 
somewhere in your project's Assets folder, such as in
Assets / Dialogue System Extras / Articy Localization Importer.
However, don't put it in the Plugins folder unless you move
the Articy Localization Importer folder into Plugins, too.
